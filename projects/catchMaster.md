##About the Project
I did this project with Jarod and YueMing last semester for ICS 211. Our project was a computer game called Catch Masters. It's a simple game where you pretend to fish. The game shows different kinds of fish and teaches players about fishing rules like what size of fish you can keep. We made the game to be fun but also to help people learn about fishing in a way that's good for nature.

##My Role
I worked a lot on this game. My main job was to write the code that made the game work. I decided how the game should play, like how you catch fish and what happens if you catch a fish that's too small. I also looked up real fishing rules to make our game realistic. I did most of the programming and made sure everything in the game worked right.

##What I Learned
Making this game taught me a lot. I learned more about how to write good computer code, especially in Java. I also learned how games can help people learn new things, like fishing rules. Working on this project showed me how to take a big idea and make it into a real game that people can play. It was really fun to see our game come to life and know that I helped make it.
