## Introduction and Concept:
Welcome to our Fishing Tournament game, Catch Masters, a text-based Java program that simulates a realistic fishing experience. This game is not just about catching fish; it's an immersive experience that combines elements of strategy, knowledge, and luck. The core idea was to create a game that is both fun and educational, teaching players about different fish species, fishing regulations, and sustainable practices. Set in a dynamic virtual environment, the game challenges players to think and act like real anglers.

## Gameplay Mechanics:
In Catch Masters, the game starts by populating a 'fish pond' with various baby fish. These fish grow over a simulated period, introducing players to different stages of fish development. Players, taking turns, have a year (12 months) of gameplay where each month offers them opportunities to catch fish using methods like nets, poles, or spears. The intriguing part of the game is its adherence to real-world fishing rules – players must consider the legal size, season, and bag limits of each fish type they catch.

## Strategy and Decision Making:
Strategic thinking is crucial in our game. During their turn, players choose whether to fish, check their catch, view fishing rules, or release fish back into the pond. This decision-making process is vital, as keeping an illegal catch leads to penalties, including the confiscation of the player's current catch. This aspect not only adds an element of challenge but also educates players on the importance of sustainable fishing practices. The game encourages players to think critically about their choices and the impact of fishing on the environment. As the game concludes after 12 months, the winner is determined by the total length of the three largest fish in their sack. This culmination tests the players’ fishing skills and strategic planning.
